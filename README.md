Create a modern, sleek website with the name "ImageGen" that allows users to generate Al images. The website should include the following pages and features:

1. Landing Page:

A modern and beautiful hero page for an image generator app. Add gradients and use good fonts to make the app look sleek.

A clean and engaging landing page with a prominent 'Get Started' button.

The button should lead to the login/sign-up flow. Create the signin and signup pages.

Do not implement the authentication logic and backend yet.

2 Dashboard Page:

Header Section:

Clickable Logo: Place a clickable logo on the upper left that redirects to the dashboard.

User Profile Menu: On the upper right, display the user's

profile picture or icon. When hovered over, show a dropdown with the options: 'Profile', 'Settings', and 'Logout'.

Create a two-column layout:

Left Column:

A prompt input field where users can enter text descriptions.

A 'Generate' button below the prompt field to trigger the image generation.

Right Column:

A placeholder area that will display the generated Al

image once available.

Ensure that if the image isn't generated yet, a placeholder image or message is shown.

Do not implement the backend yet.

Gallery Section:

Below the image generator, display a gallery of all previously generated images.

If no images have been generated, include appropriate placeholders indicating that the gallery is empty

3. Profile Page:

Create a profile page that displays:

The user's personal information.

The user's email address.

Date the user joined.

Remaining credits.

Total number of images the user has generated.

4. General Requirements:

The design should be modern and sleek with a responsive layout.

Use placeholders for images and dynamic content if actual data is not available during initial development.

Ensure the navigation is intuitive and the user experience is smooth.

Write clean, efficient code with comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Utilize best practices for frontend (and backend, if applicable) development to ensure scalability and maintainability.
